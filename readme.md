# Awesome Retool Components 🚀
A curated directory of **custom Retool components** built and shared by the community.

## Why This Exists
Retool is an incredible platform for rapidly building internal tools, but high quality custom components can be hard to discover. This list solves that by collecting the best open source or publicly shared components in one place.
You can browse, learn from, and reuse them in your own Retool apps.

## FAQ

### Can I submit a component that is not open source?
You can, but please clearly indicate its license or usage restrictions. We prefer open source entries so others can learn from and improve them.

### My component does not use React. Can I still add it?
Yes. Any custom component created for Retool - React, Vanilla JS, Web Components, etc - is welcome.

### What if my component becomes outdated?
You can submit an update or mark it as deprecated. We maintain transparency and historical accuracy.

### How are tags chosen?
Use existing tags when possible. If you propose new ones, maintainers will review them.
