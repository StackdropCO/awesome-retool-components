# Awesome Retool Components 🚀  
A curated list of **custom Retool components** built by the community — community-maintained and updated.

## Why this list?  
Retool is a powerful platform for building internal tools. Yet the ecosystem of custom components is still growing. This list aims to:  
- collect and categorize high-quality, open-source or freely shareable custom Retool components,  
- help developers discover, evaluate and reuse them,  
- welcome new contributions and promote reuse.

## How to use  
Browse the list below. For each component you’ll typically find:  
- 🔧 A short description  
- 📦 Link to GitHub (or other repository)  
- 🧪 Demo or screenshot if available  
- 📝 Supported Retool version / dependencies  
- 🧩 Category tags (e.g., charts, tables, forms, UX enhancements)  

If you want to contribute a component, see [Instructions for Contributors](#instructions-for-contributors) below.
