## Contribution Guidelines
To maintain quality and consistency, please follow these rules:

### Required Fields
Each component entry must include:
- Name
- 1 to 2 sentence description
- Repository link
- Tags (categories such as `form`, `ui`, `chart`, `analytics`, etc)

Optional but encouraged:
- Screenshot
- Demo link
- Supported Retool version
- Dependencies (React versions, libraries, etc)

### Before Creating a PR
- Search to ensure your component is not already listed
- Make sure your link works
- If using images, keep them lightweight
- Use consistent formatting with other items in the list

### When PRs Get Rejected
Submissions may be rejected if:
- They are extremely low quality
- The repo is empty or not publicly accessible
- The component is not actually a Retool component
- The formatting is not fixed after a maintainer requests changes
